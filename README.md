<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

These Are The Dummy Demonstration Of Design & Architecturing API's for a Adding Weather Data 

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the api and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mohit8982/weather-api.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the Server in Developent or Production
   ```sh
   npm run dev or npm start
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

There are 2 API's in this weather forcast, which anyone can explore by getting repository clone & then 
importing the postman collection to explore API.

_For more examples, please import the postman collection [COLLECTION](https://github.com/Mohit8982/weather-api/tree/main/postman)_

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Future Implementation

There are many things we can implement by using this weather API like :
  
  1. Making Graph For Weather Up & Down According to City Selected.
  2. Making a Interactie Frontend According to weather for ex. if it's raining then we can have some rain effect as background.
  3. Using Historical Weather data we can make prediction using ML or any other tool.
  4. Can make things Dynamic accoding to user location.
  5. Implement Some realtime feature.
  
 There are many more cool thing we can implement using this API's
